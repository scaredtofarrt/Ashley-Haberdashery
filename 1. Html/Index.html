	<h2> <b>Why I love to cook</b></h2>
	<p> <b><i>The love of food started early for me coming home to an aroma of freshly
		made with love food by my mother or father. Being in a kitchen is not for everyone, the heat, sharp knives, complicating recipes. Once I was old enough and force to cook in a good postive way i enjoyed cutting and baking delcious meals for my family. Fulled with lots of laughs and a ton of crying on my behalf I can fully apperciate the lessons that I was taught by my family.</b></i></p>
